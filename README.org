#+title: 私のプロフィルようこそ！

Hallo, I am midnight, a programmer (I think). I like making software and forgetting to publish it.

Feel free to check some of my projects, all of them are free for you to use as you please, and most of them are unnecessarily documented so you can understand everything despite my skills in italian style coding.

If there is anything you want to tell me, or talk about, I am more active on discord. @midnight_the_rock
